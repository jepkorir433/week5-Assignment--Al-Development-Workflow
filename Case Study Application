Problem Scope (5 points)
Problem: Predict the risk of patient readmission within 30 days post-discharge to enable proactive interventions.
Objectives:

Reduce avoidable readmissions and associated costs.

Improve patient outcomes through targeted care (e.g., follow-up calls, home visits).

Optimize hospital resource allocation.
Stakeholders:

Patients (receive personalized care).

Clinicians (identify high-risk patients).

Hospital Administrators (reduce penalties under value-based care models).

Payers (lower costs via preventive care).

Regulatory Bodies (ensure compliance with healthcare standards).

Data Strategy (10 points)
1. Data Sources:

EHRs: Diagnosis codes, medications, lab results, discharge notes.

Demographics: Age, gender, race, ZIP code (proxy for socioeconomic status).

Clinical History: Prior admissions, comorbidities (e.g., Charlson Index).

Operational Data: Length of stay, discharge disposition (e.g., home vs. facility).

External Data: Social determinants of health (e.g., via public databases linked to ZIP code).

2. Ethical Concerns:

Patient Privacy: Risk of re-identification via ZIP code + rare diagnoses.
Mitigation: Aggregate ZIP codes; use differential privacy.

Bias: Model may underperform for marginalized groups (e.g., due to uneven historical care access).
Mitigation: Stratify data sampling; audit model fairness across subgroups.

3. Preprocessing Pipeline:

Cleaning: Remove duplicates; impute missing lab values (median) or drop features >30% missing.

Feature Engineering:

Temporal: "Days since last admission," "Number of past readmissions."

Clinical: "Polypharmacy flag" (>10 medications), "Comorbidity burden score."

Operational: "Discharge to rehabilitation facility" (binary).

Encoding: One-hot encode diagnoses (ICD-10 codes); scale numerical features (StandardScaler).

Class Handling: Address imbalance via SMOTE or class weighting.

Model Development (10 points)
1. Model Selection:

Choice: Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM).

Justification:

Handles mixed data types (numeric/categorical).

Captures non-linear relationships (e.g., medication interactions).

Provides feature importance for clinical interpretability.

2. Confusion Matrix & Metrics (Hypothetical):

Data: 1,000 patients; 150 readmissions (15% positive class).

Confusion Matrix:

Predicted: No	Predicted: Yes
Actual: No	700 (TN)	100 (FP)
Actual: Yes	50 (FN)	150 (TP)
Precision: TP / (TP + FP) = 150 / (150 + 100) = 0.60
Interpretation: 60% of high-risk predictions are correct.

Recall: TP / (TP + FN) = 150 / (150 + 50) = 0.75
Interpretation: Captures 75% of actual readmissions.

Deployment (10 points)
1. Integration Steps:

API Development: Wrap model in a REST API (e.g., Flask/FastAPI).

EHR Integration: Trigger predictions via discharge-triggered events (e.g., using HL7/FHIR standards).

Dashboard: Display risk scores in clinician dashboards with explanations (SHAP values).

Batch Updates: Retrain model monthly with new data.

2. Regulatory Compliance (HIPAA):

Data Security:

Encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).

Store data in HIPAA-compliant cloud (e.g., AWS HIPAA BAA).

Access Control: Role-based access (e.g., clinicians only).

Auditability: Maintain prediction logs for audits.

De-identification: Use in development; real data only in secure production.

_Optimization_ (5 points)
Method to Address Overfitting:

Regularization via Cross-Validation:

Use 5-fold cross-validation to tune hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, learning_rate).

Add penalties: Increase reg_alpha (L1) and reg_lambda (L2) in XGBoost to suppress noisy features.

Impact: Reduces model complexity, ensuring robustness to unseen data.
